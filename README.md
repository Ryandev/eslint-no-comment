# eslint-plugin-no-comment ðŸ«¢
Disable use of comment style, either '//' or '/*'


### Usage
â€¢Â *Add package* 
  `yarn add -D eslint-plugin-no-comment` or `npm install --save-dev eslint-plugin-no-comment`

â€¢ *Enable plugin*, 
Add `no-comment` to the plugins section of your `.eslintrc` configuration file. You can omit the `eslint-plugin-` prefix:

```json
{
    "plugins": [
        "no-comment"
    ]
}
```

â€¢ *Enable rule*
Then configure the rules under the rules section.

```json
{
    "rules": {
        "no-comment/no-comment-line": "error"
    }
}
```


### Reasoning
All modern editors provide keyboard shortcuts to turn an existing line of code into a comment typically `Cmd+'/'` the problem is that this change can be forgotten about & maybe missed during a pull-request review leaving commented out code into the main branch & without reasoning why it was there.

Adding `eslint-no-comment/no-comment-line` will flag this & provided eslint is executed during the commit/deployment stage this will be flagged & addressed before delivery

### Example
Demo project showing rule in use: [demo-eslint-plugin-no-comment](https://github.com/Ryandev/demo-eslint-plugin-no-comment)


### Notes
â€¢Â No auto fix functionality is provided & should not be. Based on the reasoning above, doing so would not help resolve the underlying issue

â€¢Â `eslint-no-comment/no-comment-block` Added too, however unlikely to be used based on #reasoning above
