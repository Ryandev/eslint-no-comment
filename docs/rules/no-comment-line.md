# Disable use of // line comments (`no-comment/no-comment-line`)

🔧 This rule is automatically fixable by the [`--fix` CLI option](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/command-line-interface#--fix).

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Disable use of double slash comments. Modern IDEs make it very convenient to disable a line of code which can often happen during debugging. If this is missed during code review it can result in commented out code in production. 

If a comment is needed use `/* */` style comments as there is no shortcut & is guaranteed to be intentional
